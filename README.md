<h2> Feedback </h2>

After an initial design, I sent it out to some colleagues in email with the following questions:
<ul>
  <li>What do you notice in the chart? Any interesting relationships or trends?</li>
<li> What questions do you have about the data/ graphic? </li>
<li> What do you think is the main takeaway from this chart?</li>
<li> What could make it prettier/ easier to understand?</li>
  </ul>

<h3> Colleague 1 </h3>:
Well, i see that as there is increase in students, there is decrease in performance (exam) at the same time, for grade 5-6.
Initially it took me 4 mins to understand the graph then I could understand.
The main takeaway is the rise in number of students as positive, the decrease in result as negative
Yes, definitely this can be made better by following a visual color palette, color tint difference between blocks(i.e. color grows darker from one block to another.) and the trend line in contrast color.or use padding between the blocks. 

<h3> Colleague 2 </h3>: 
Hmm... I see a steep rise in enrolment from 5 to 6 grades; a decline in enrolment from grade 7 to 8 (besides Khanpur, the others like less stark / negligible). 
For the marks section, why doesn't the Y axis show till 100%; a line high on the graph seems misleading at first sight, especially since it's showing in percentage.
Also why is the first grade colored differently?

<h3> Colleague 3 </h3>
The percentage chart isn't the right choice. You should be asking 'for Class 5, which are the highest performers.' I would want to know where I have the highest number of students. 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th- which school is getting the best marks?

<h3> Colleague 4 </h3>
When I saw this, it's very evident it's giving enrollment vs  percentage performance. Self-explanatory. For me- as an external person- maybe I haven't seen these kinds of graphs. So for me I'm able to relate to the bigger picture. More than giving me text, this data is really evidence. Shows me a trend between performance and enrollment. So to relate that to the problem is very important.
