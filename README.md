<h2> Feedback </h2>

The initial design led to following feedback from colleagues:
Colleague 1: There ought to be padding 


Colleague 2: A steep rise in enrolment from 5 to 6 grades; a decline in enrolment from grade 7 to 8 (besides Khanpur, the others like less stark / negligible). 
For the marks section, why doesn't the Y axis show till 100%; a line high on the graph seems misleading at first sight, especially since it's showing in percentage.
Also why is the first grade colored differently?
